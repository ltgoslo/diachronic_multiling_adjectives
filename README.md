# Diachronic semantic shifts in adjectives

This repository accompanies the paper 'Measuring diachronic evolution of evaluative adjectives with distributional models: the case for English, Norwegian, and Russian'

It contains the lists of evaluative adjectives for English, Norwegian and Russian, and the code to measure the speed of semantic change using word embeddings. Diachronic word embedding models for these languages can be downloaded at the [NLPL Vectors repository](http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/).



# Paper abstract
We measure the intensity of diachronic semantic shifts in adjectives in English, Norwegian and Russian across 5 decades. This is done in order to test the hypothesis that evaluative adjectives are more prone to temporal semantic change. To this end, 6 different methods of quantifying semantic change are used.

Frequency-controlled experimental results show that, depending on the particular method, evaluative adjectives either do not differ from other types of adjectives in terms of semantic change or appear to actually be less prone to shifting (particularly, to 'jitter'-type shifting). Thus, in spite of many well-known examples of semantically changing evaluative adjectives (like 'terrific' or 'incredible'), it seems that such cases are not specific to this particular type of words.
